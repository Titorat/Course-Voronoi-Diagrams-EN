# About Voronoi Diagrams
This course is a simple approach to Voronoi Diagrams theory.
## Previous Knowledge:
Basic programming knowledge: Variables, Arrays, Loops, Functions and Geometry.
Javascript is used on the Course due to the visual nature of the exercises.
## Difficulty Level: 
Intermediate.
## Estimated Time:
15 minutes.
## What will I learn?
Students will learn what a Voronoi Diagram is, and some use cases.
## Why should I learn?
Voronoi Diagrams can be used on:
-  Spatial analysis & Resource organization: Mobile phone base stations, emergency modeling, geomarketing, etc.
-  Game AI: Maximize controlled area, find items where you always reach faster than the enemy, safest route,etc.
-  Many other applications: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gina/scot.drysdale.html & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#Applications
