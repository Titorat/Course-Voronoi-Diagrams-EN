# About Voronoi Diagrams
This course is a simple approach to Voronoi Diagrams theory.
## Requirements
Basic programming knowledge: Variables, Arrays, Loops, Functions and Geometry.

Javascript is used in this course due to the visual nature of the examples, but it's not a requirement. The course has simple programming exercises that can be solved with minimal programming knowledge.

## Difficulty Level
Intermediate.
## Estimated Time
15 minutes.
## What will I learn?
Students will learn what a Voronoi Diagram is, and some use cases.
## Why should I learn?
Voronoi Diagrams can be used on:
-  Spatial analysis & Resource organization: Mobile phone base stations, emergency modeling, geomarketing, etc.
-  Game AI: Maximize controlled area, find items where you always reach faster than the enemy, safest route, etc.
-  [Many other applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#Applications)
