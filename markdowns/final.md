# Final words

In this Course we learned the basics of Voronoi Diagrams. The concept is simple yet powerful, and Voronoi Diagrams are widely used on many fields.

**Pros**

- Simple concept, easy to understand and to apply.

**Cons**

- Voronoi Diagrams can't deal with real-time distances. A planned emergency response diagram renders useless if traffic jams affect ambulances travel time.
- Resource intensive. Naive implementation is O(n^2) complex. Fortune's algorithm is O(n log(n)) complex.

## Codingame Puzzles 
There are many Codingame puzzles where you can use Voronoi Diagrams:

As you see, a lot of game AI's make use of Voronoi diagrams. Maximizing controlled area or knowing what resources can be taken faster than the enemy is important in game AI.
